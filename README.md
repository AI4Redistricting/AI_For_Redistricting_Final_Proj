# Python Files and Final Project Report on Gerrymandering Analysis in Illinois


## Authors: Austin Asher, Abi Mengesha, Jeremiah Brown




### Overview

* *This project conducts a thorough analysis of potential gerrymandering in Illinois's Senate and Presidential election districts using the GerryChain library. The analysis involves generating Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations to assess district fairness through various metrics like cut edges, efficiency gaps, and mean-median differences. The results of this project contribute to understanding how the redrawing of district boundaries may disproportionately favor the Democratic party, potentially diluting minority voting power.*
